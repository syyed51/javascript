# let

A variable is named container used for storing values.

```javascript
let name;
```

This statement:

1. Reserve a container in memory, call it `name`.

1. `Type` will be decided at run-time (i.e when you assign it a value.)

1. `Size` of the container, will also be dynamic.

1. The container will be `initialized` with value `undefined`.

1. It will have lexical scope.

1. And will be `garbage collected`, when there are no `references` to it. Directly or indirectly.
