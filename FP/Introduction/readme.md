# Function vs procedure


In functional programming, functions are expected to behave like functions in calculus and not procesures in progamming. 

```js
f(x) = 2x + 3
```
1. They take some input. 
1. Do some processing on it. 
1. Return the result. 

> It's worth noting that functional purity is observation and not acedamic. 

Here is some vocabulary related to functional arity. 

### One argument, `Unary functions`

```js
function uniary(arg)
```
### Two arguments, `Binary function`

```js
function binary(arg1, arg2)
```

### Three arguments, `Ternary function`

```js
function ternary(arg1, arg2)
```

### More than two arguments, `N-ary` or `Variatic function`

```js
function variatic(arg1, arg2, arg3)
```
